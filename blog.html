    <article>        <p>Hey everyone, I'm CodeWiseOwl and the exciting world of web development has captured my attention! 
        <br>
        While I've been dipping my toes in Python, 
        <br>
        I'm eager to dive headfirst into front-end development.

            As a complete beginner, I'm starting my journey with the foundational languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  My goal?  To unlock the power to create beautiful, interactive web experiences!
                        
            Here's a quick breakdown of what each language brings to the table:
            <br>
            <br>
            HTML: The backbone of any web page, HTML provides the 
            structure and content. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Imagine it as the blueprint for your website.
            <br>
            <br>
            CSS: This is where things get stylish! CSS allows you to control the look and feel of your web page, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
            <br>
            <br>
            JavaScript: Want to add some pizzazz and interactivity? JavaScript is your secret weapon! It brings your web pages to life with dynamic features and user engagement.
            By mastering these core languages, I'll be well on my way to crafting fantastic websites.  Feel free to join me on this exciting adventure!  I'm always open to learning from others and sharing my progress.
